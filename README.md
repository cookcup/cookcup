# CookCup

**CookCup** is a lightweight, simple and semantic DOM toolbox.

Some people say that jQuery is outdated but simply not using it would be the best solution? This library was created to answer this question, looking for alternative, organized and modern ways to manipulate the good old DOM. So, this library was written in top of EcmaScript and inspired by (but unlike) jQuery.

## Install

By default we provide two ways to install, **browser** and **package**.

### Browser

Just add this library using our CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cookcup">
```

It is strongly recommended that you load the script with the `async` attribute, we have a [small guide](https://github.com/cookcup/cookcup/wiki/Guide:-Asynchronous-load) learning how to handle with it.

Or just customize your build, download files and host it directly in your website.

### Package

Or just install it on your project:

```bash
$ npm install cookcup
```

```bash
$ yarn add cookcup
```

Don't forget to import the library:

```javascript
import cc from 'cookcup'
```
